The puepose of the analysis is to understand the riders and driers difference depending on the location urban,rural,and suburban. Comparing the differnce allows us to improve the quilty of the service for the area and increase profits.
Results: 
According to the results Urban drivers have the most sucess compared to rural and suburban. Urban areas are proving to be most profiable with the highest number of drivers,Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride    Average Fare per Driver. Suburban areas are second in line in all the these categories. Rural is the lowest in the list.

Summary:
Having more drivers does help in tyoe of situation. Creating larger fare amounts would also help in the process. It seems that Rural areas would improve with higher fares for drivers but also increase the number of drivers in the area. For example, if their are more drivers in the area riders would not have to wait for long time (5min-10min, max), but because riders don't have to wait as much drivers should also charge more for the trip. Hence increasing profits and increaing riders
